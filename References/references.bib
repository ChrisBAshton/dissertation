This practical book helps you sort it out, first by grounding you in agileâ€™s underlying principles, then by describing four specificâ€”and well-usedâ€”agile methods: Scrum, extreme programming (XP), Lean, and Kanban.Each method focuses on a different area of development, but they all aim to change your teamâ€™s mindsetâ€”from individuals who simply follow a plan to a cohesive group that makes decisions together. Whether youâ€™re considering agile for the first time, or trying it again, youâ€™ll learn how to choose a method that best fits your team and your company.Understand the purpose behind agileâ€™s core values and principlesLearn Scrumâ€™s emphasis on project management, self-organization, and collective commitmentFocus on software design and architecture with XP practices such as test-first and pair programmingUse Lean thinking to empower your team, eliminate waste, and deliver software fastLearn how Kanbanâ€™s practices help you deliver great software by managing flowAdopt agile practices and principles with an agile coach},

abstract = {Litigation in court is still the main dispute resolution mode. However, given the amount and characteristics of the new disputes, mostly arising out of electronic contracting, courts are becoming slower and outdated. Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) recently emerged as a set of tools and techniques, supported by technology, aimed at facilitating conflict resolution. In this paper we present a critical evaluation on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques in ODR. In order to fulfill this goal, we analyze a set of commercial providers (in this case twenty four) and some research projects (in this circumstance six). Supported by the results so far achieved, a new approach to deal with the problem of ODR is proposed, in which we take on some of the problems identified in the current state of the art in linking ODR and AI.},

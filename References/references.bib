In terms of the kind of disputes they're solving today, it's mainly high-volume, low-value disputes that arise from e-commerce, but they also resolve divorces and property tax assessment appeals. He claims that the best application of the technology is high volume, low value cases, since multi-million dollar cases are valuable enough to justify getting a lawyer and going through the court process.},

@article{Carneiro2014,
abstract = {Litigation in court is still the main dispute resolution mode. However, given the amount and characteristics of the new disputes, mostly arising out of electronic contracting, courts are becoming slower and outdated. Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) recently emerged as a set of tools and techniques, supported by technology, aimed at facilitating conflict resolution. In this paper we present a critical evaluation on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques in ODR. In order to fulfill this goal, we analyze a set of commercial providers (in this case twenty four) and some research projects (in this circumstance six). Supported by the results so far achieved, a new approach to deal with the problem of ODR is proposed, in which we take on some of the problems identified in the current state of the art in linking ODR and AI.},

This paper explores artificial intelligence driven solutions in the field of Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), using maritime collisions as an example implementation. Maritime law being reasonably terse and straightforward, it was hypothesised that it should be possible to apply the rules of maritime law to the business logic of an ODR platform, but in an abstract way such that any module encapsulating any type of law could extend the core system.

Alongside this report is an open-source and extensible ODR platform, prototype maritime collision module and vendor website. This paper justifies the design, implementation and testing strategy for all three components, and discusses where this platform, dubbed \emph{SmartResolution}, would head next beyond the scope of an undergraduate dissertation and what this could mean for the field of ODR in general.

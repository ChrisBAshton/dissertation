This paper explores AI-driven solutions in the field of Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), using Maritime Collisions as an example implementation.

It delivers an enterprise-level, abstract and extensible ODR platform and an early prototype of the maritime collision module. The paper discusses where this platform, dubbed SmartResolution, would head next beyond the scope of an undergraduate dissertation, and what it could mean for the field of online dispute resolution in general.

\chapter{Third-Party Code and Libraries}

I will begin by listing the third-party code, libraries, frameworks and images used by the three components of this dissertation. The full description for each dependency can be found at the end of this appendix, in alphabetical order.

\section{SmartResolution website}

smartresolution.org uses a number of third-party frameworks and services:

\begin{itemize}
\item Bootstrap: this is used for the front-end styling and as a UI framework.
\item Fat-Free Framework: this powers the back-end, allowing me to define HTTP routes and their handlers.
\item phpDocumentor: this is used to generate API documentation from the Docblock comments in the core SmartResolution software.
\item SlickNav: responsive mobile menu.
\item jQuery: a dependency for the plugin above.
\end{itemize}

It is worth noting that the design and creation of the installation icons at \url{http://smartresolution.org/documentation} were outsourced to a friend of mine. It is also worth explaining that, though smartresolution.org is hosted on AWS, it is server-agnostic and no AWS-specific assets exist in the repository. Therefore, I will not be discussing the use of AWS here.

\section{SmartResolution}

As SmartResolution is more substantial than the website which hosts it, it is necessary to split its dependencies into certain categories.

\subsection{Front-end}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bootstrap: for front-end styling and as a UI framework.
\item jQuery Date and Time picker: for a user-friendly way of negotiating dispute lifespans.
\item jQuery: a dependency required by the plugin above.
\item The dashboard icons used in the core platform are designed by Freepik.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Back-end}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fat-Free Framework: routes HTTP requests to controllers and also handles database interaction and password encryption.
\item SQLite: the RDBMS used by SmartResolution for persistence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development dependencies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rubygems: for handling Ruby dependencies.
\item Composer: for handling PHP dependencies.
\item Cucumber: the BDD framework in use for end-to-end testing.
\item RSpec, Capybara and Poltergeist as the Cucumber drivers.
\item PHPUnit: for providing methods for (and subsequently executing) PHP unit tests.
\item Symfony's YAML component: for handling PHP's parsing of YAML files, used by SmartResolution's PHP unit tests.
\end{itemize}

\section{Maritime collision module}

No third-party libraries were used in the development of the module. All code is native PHP/HTML and all assets (such as the anchor image) were taken from the public domain (in this case, pixabay.org).

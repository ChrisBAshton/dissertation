I'd like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Georgios Gkoutos, for always being available to answer my questions and for giving me direction, particularly in the early stages of the project. I'd also like to thank Dr. Constantina Sampani and Dr. Alexandros Giagkos for introducing me to the concept of online dispute resolution and for their technical expertise throughout the project.

I am grateful to all of the third-party services that were generous enough to provide their services for free or at a substantial student discount. These include GitHub, Travis, CodeClimate, Gemnasium, ShareLatex and others.

Finally, I'd like to thank all of the hard-working contributors to the open-source frameworks and libraries that made this project possible.
